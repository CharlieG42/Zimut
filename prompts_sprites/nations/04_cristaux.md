# Nation Cristaux (Cristaux)

Palette : silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet. Effets : prismatic blue and violet crystal shards. Contre-jour : violet.

Format 3 planches par personnage (V44) :

1. **Vues** — 4 cases : repos de FACE ×2 (deux attitudes différentes) puis repos de DOS ×2, tout orienté vers la droite (le jeu retourne l'image pour la gauche). Grille 2 × 2 sur image 2:1, poses largement espacées. Génération normale.
2. **Actions de face** — 3 attaques + 2 sorts + 1 marche (3 colonnes × 2 rangées), en **édition** de la planche vues : le personnage réellement dessiné sert d'ancre.
3. **Actions de dos** — les mêmes 6 poses vues de dos, en édition de la planche vues. Une planche = un seul sens de vue (face et dos mélangés sur une même planche étaient dessinés de face). Facultative pour les monstres.

Les personnages **armés** ont l'arme écrite dans la première phrase, dans la carte d'identité, en fin de prompt et dans chaque pose ; les **créatures** reçoivent « UNARMED » (plus de torche inventée). Chaque prompt recopie la carte d'identité (`identites.py`) : aucune image à joindre. Ordre conseillé : 1) planche de style, 2) héros, 3) ennemis, 4) boss ; pour chaque personnage : vues, actions de face, actions de dos. Prompt négatif : en bas de page.

## 1. Planche de référence (style de la nation)

Ne sert pas en jeu : elle fixe palette, matières et silhouettes, de face et de dos.

```text
Character lineup reference sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG: the Cristaux nation (Cristaux biome).
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet. Signature effects: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: two rows with the same 6 characters in the same order, all in idle pose. Top row: 3/4 front view, facing front-right. Bottom row: 3/4 back view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right. All feet of a row on the same ground line. Leave a wide empty gap (at least half a character width) between characters and between the two rows: nobody overlaps or touches anyone, weapons and capes included. Image aspect ratio 2:1, as large as possible.
CHARACTERS, left to right:
1. the hero (Mage: young mage with dark blue hair, long silver-white robe with crystal patterns and sapphire trims, an ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal in the right hand).
2. Araignée de cristal (spider made of violet amethyst crystals with ice-blue glowing legs).
3. Mage cristallin (slender crystal mage with violet crystal hair and a pale blue body, crystal staff).
4. Golem de cristal (heavy golem made of violet and blue crystal clusters).
5. Élémentaire de cristal (floating elemental made of sharp violet crystal shards in a humanoid shape).
6. the final boss Zyphéron le Cristallin (tall crystal sorcerer with a crown of ice-blue shards, long robe of shattered pale crystal plates, holding an ornate crystal staff), about 1.5x taller than the others.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat medium gray background (#808080) (the character is pale, a white background would merge with it), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.

Sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE playable hero: Mage, armed with: ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal (#5CC8FF), RIGHT hand.
The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites of the SAME character: the top row shows it from the FRONT twice (two different relaxed stances), the bottom row shows it from BEHIND twice (two different relaxed stances). Same design, same outfit, same colors, same size in all 4 cells.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Mage (hero of the Cristaux nation)
- Hair: dark navy-blue hair (#1E2C5A), medium length, side bangs
- Eyes: bright blue eyes (#3FA0FF), always open
- Skin: fair skin
- Top: long silver-white robe (#E8ECF4) with light-blue crystal patterns and sapphire trims (#2A5BD7)
- Bottom: the robe reaches the ankles, dark blue trousers visible below
- Feet: dark blue boots with silver tips
- Weapon: ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal (#5CC8FF), RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no wizard hat, no white or silver hair, no beard.
WEAPON: ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal (#5CC8FF), RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in all 4 cells: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites — one per cell of the 2 x 2 grid, never more, no extra or duplicated row. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
CELLS — follow the grid positions EXACTLY:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
Every sprite faces RIGHT (front-right on the top row, away toward the upper right on the bottom row): never facing left, never a pure side profile. The two sprites of a row are clearly different stances, never the same drawing twice.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat medium gray background (#808080) (the character is pale, a white background would merge with it), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
WEAPON CHECK: ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal (#5CC8FF), RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in every cell: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
REMINDER: this is Mage: ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal (#5CC8FF), RIGHT hand; dark navy-blue hair (#1E2C5A), medium length, side bangs; bright blue eyes (#3FA0FF), always open; long silver-white robe (#E8ECF4) with light-blue crystal patterns and sapphire trims (#2A5BD7); fair skin; the robe reaches the ankles, dark blue trousers visible below; dark blue boots with silver tips. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no wizard hat, no white or silver hair, no beard. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

CRITICAL — KEEP THE VIEWS: the top row stays FRONT views and the bottom row stays BACK views; the two sprites of a row stay two different stances. Never redraw the whole sheet from a single angle:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.

WEAPON: ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal (#5CC8FF), RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in every cell: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
CHANGE NOTHING ELSE: keep the exact same character, poses, sizes, outfit, hair, background and layout.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image.
REMINDER: this is Mage: ornate silver staff topped with a glowing blue crystal (#5CC8FF), RIGHT hand; dark navy-blue hair (#1E2C5A), medium length, side bangs; bright blue eyes (#3FA0FF), always open; long silver-white robe (#E8ECF4) with light-blue crystal patterns and sapphire trims (#2A5BD7); fair skin; the robe reaches the ankles, dark blue trousers visible below; dark blue boots with silver tips. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no wizard hat, no white or silver hair, no beard.

Sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE enemy monster: Araignée de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites of the SAME character: the top row shows it from the FRONT twice (two different relaxed stances), the bottom row shows it from BEHIND twice (two different relaxed stances). Same design, same outfit, same colors, same size in all 4 cells.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Araignée de cristal (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: spider with a round body made of violet amethyst crystals (#8A4FD8)
- Head: cluster of small glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF), crystal fangs
- Details: eight thin glowing ice-blue crystal legs (#9FE3FF)
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no fur, no green, no human body.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in all 4 cells; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites — one per cell of the 2 x 2 grid, never more, no extra or duplicated row. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
CELLS — follow the grid positions EXACTLY:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
Every sprite faces RIGHT (front-right on the top row, away toward the upper right on the bottom row): never facing left, never a pure side profile. The two sprites of a row are clearly different stances, never the same drawing twice.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF) — not cream, not beige, not ivory, no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in every cell; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
REMINDER: this is Araignée de cristal: spider with a round body made of violet amethyst crystals (#8A4FD8); cluster of small glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF), crystal fangs; eight thin glowing ice-blue crystal legs (#9FE3FF). NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no fur, no green, no human body. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Image edit of a sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE enemy monster: Araignée de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows this enemy monster, Araignée de cristal, 4 times: top row from the FRONT twice, bottom row from BEHIND twice, all facing right.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Araignée de cristal (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: spider with a round body made of violet amethyst crystals (#8A4FD8)
- Head: cluster of small glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF), crystal fangs
- Details: eight thin glowing ice-blue crystal legs (#9FE3FF)
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no fur, no green, no human body.
TASK: REMOVE every weapon, torch, tool or held object from the hands, claws or tail — this creature is unarmed. Nothing else changes.
CRITICAL — KEEP THE VIEWS: the top row stays FRONT views and the bottom row stays BACK views; the two sprites of a row stay two different stances. Never redraw the whole sheet from a single angle:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in every cell; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
CHANGE NOTHING ELSE: keep the exact same character, poses, sizes, outfit, hair, background and layout.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image.
REMINDER: this is Araignée de cristal: spider with a round body made of violet amethyst crystals (#8A4FD8); cluster of small glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF), crystal fangs; eight thin glowing ice-blue crystal legs (#9FE3FF). NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no fur, no green, no human body. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Image edit — sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 6 action poses seen from the FRONT of ONE enemy monster: Araignée de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows this enemy monster, Araignée de cristal, in 4 idle views (top row from the front, bottom row from behind). Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Araignée de cristal (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: spider with a round body made of violet amethyst crystals (#8A4FD8)
- Head: cluster of small glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF), crystal fangs
- Details: eight thin glowing ice-blue crystal legs (#9FE3FF)
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no fur, no green, no human body.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in all 6 poses; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
TASK: replace the 4 idle views with 6 ACTION poses, ALL in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose, facing front-right in every pose. Never a pure side profile, never facing left.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. REARING: standing up on the hind legs, front claws raised high.
2. POUNCE: body stretched forward in the air, jaws open.
3. SIDE SWIPE: head and claws swept to the side, body twisted.
4. HOWL: head raised to the sky, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards gathering around the body.
5. ROAR: mouth wide open, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards burst in front of the head.
6. WALK: mid-stride, one front paw raised, body moving forward.
The 6 poses MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF) — not cream, not beige, not ivory), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Araignée de cristal: spider with a round body made of violet amethyst crystals (#8A4FD8); cluster of small glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF), crystal fangs; eight thin glowing ice-blue crystal legs (#9FE3FF). NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no fur, no green, no human body. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE enemy monster: Mage cristallin, armed with: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand.
The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites of the SAME character: the top row shows it from the FRONT twice (two different relaxed stances), the bottom row shows it from BEHIND twice (two different relaxed stances). Same design, same outfit, same colors, same size in all 4 cells.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Mage cristallin (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: slender crystal mage with a smooth pale blue body (#BFD8FF)
- Head: hair made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), glowing white eyes
- Top: short dark violet robe with silver trims
- Weapon: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no human skin, no hat, no hood.
WEAPON: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in all 4 cells: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites — one per cell of the 2 x 2 grid, never more, no extra or duplicated row. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
CELLS — follow the grid positions EXACTLY:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
Every sprite faces RIGHT (front-right on the top row, away toward the upper right on the bottom row): never facing left, never a pure side profile. The two sprites of a row are clearly different stances, never the same drawing twice.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF) — not cream, not beige, not ivory, no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
WEAPON CHECK: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in every cell: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
REMINDER: this is Mage cristallin: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand; short dark violet robe with silver trims; slender crystal mage with a smooth pale blue body (#BFD8FF); hair made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), glowing white eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no human skin, no hat, no hood. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

WEAPON: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in all 6 poses: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
TASK: replace the 4 idle views with 6 ACTION poses, ALL in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose, facing front-right in every pose.

```text
Image edit — sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 6 action poses seen from BEHIND of ONE enemy monster: Mage cristallin, armed with: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand.
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows this enemy monster, Mage cristallin, in 4 idle views (top row from the front, bottom row from behind). Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories, weapon in the same hand. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged. Use the BACK views of the source as the reference for the back of the outfit.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Mage cristallin (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: slender crystal mage with a smooth pale blue body (#BFD8FF)
- Head: hair made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), glowing white eyes
- Top: short dark violet robe with silver trims
- Weapon: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no human skin, no hat, no hood.
WEAPON: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in all 6 poses: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
TASK: replace the 4 idle views with 6 ACTION poses, ALL in the same view: 3/4 BACK view: the character is seen from behind and turns slightly to the right (back of the head and right shoulder visible), facing away from the viewer toward the upper right; we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes. Never a pure side profile, never facing left; no face and no eyes visible in any pose.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. OVERHEAD STRIKE: staff raised high above the head with both hands.
2. THRUST: body leaning forward, staff tip pushed far ahead with a short prismatic blue and violet crystal shards spark.
3. SIDE SWING: staff swept horizontally at shoulder height, torso twisted.
4. FOCUS: eyes closed, staff held vertically in front of the face, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards orb at the top.
5. INVOCATION: staff raised high with both hands, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards swirling above the head.
6. WALK: mid-stride, one foot raised, arms swinging naturally, weapon held.
The 6 poses MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF) — not cream, not beige, not ivory), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
WEAPON CHECK: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand — visible in EVERY one of the 6 poses (held or used).
REMINDER: this is Mage cristallin: slim crystal staff with a violet crystal tip, RIGHT hand; short dark violet robe with silver trims; slender crystal mage with a smooth pale blue body (#BFD8FF); hair made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), glowing white eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no human skin, no hat, no hood. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE enemy monster: Golem de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites of the SAME character: the top row shows it from the FRONT twice (two different relaxed stances), the bottom row shows it from BEHIND twice (two different relaxed stances). Same design, same outfit, same colors, same size in all 4 cells.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Golem de cristal (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: heavy golem made of violet (#8A4FD8) and blue (#4F7FE0) crystal clusters on a dark grey rock core
- Head: small head of crystal with two glowing white eyes
- Details: huge crystal fists
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no weapon, no green, no moss.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in all 4 cells; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites — one per cell of the 2 x 2 grid, never more, no extra or duplicated row. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
CELLS — follow the grid positions EXACTLY:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
Every sprite faces RIGHT (front-right on the top row, away toward the upper right on the bottom row): never facing left, never a pure side profile. The two sprites of a row are clearly different stances, never the same drawing twice.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF) — not cream, not beige, not ivory, no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in every cell; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
REMINDER: this is Golem de cristal: heavy golem made of violet (#8A4FD8) and blue (#4F7FE0) crystal clusters on a dark grey rock core; small head of crystal with two glowing white eyes; huge crystal fists. NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no weapon, no green, no moss. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Image edit of a sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE enemy monster: Golem de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows this enemy monster, Golem de cristal, 4 times: top row from the FRONT twice, bottom row from BEHIND twice, all facing right.

- Body: heavy golem made of violet (#8A4FD8) and blue (#4F7FE0) crystal clusters on a dark grey rock core
- Head: small head of crystal with two glowing white eyes
- Details: huge crystal fists
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no weapon, no green, no moss.
TASK: REMOVE every weapon, torch, tool or held object from the hands, claws or tail — this creature is unarmed. Nothing else changes.
CRITICAL — KEEP THE VIEWS: the top row stays FRONT views and the bottom row stays BACK views; the two sprites of a row stay two different stances. Never redraw the whole sheet from a single angle:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in every cell; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
CHANGE NOTHING ELSE: keep the exact same character, poses, sizes, outfit, hair, background and layout.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image.
REMINDER: this is Golem de cristal: heavy golem made of violet (#8A4FD8) and blue (#4F7FE0) crystal clusters on a dark grey rock core; small head of crystal with two glowing white eyes; huge crystal fists. NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no weapon, no green, no moss. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE enemy monster: Élémentaire de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites of the SAME character: the top row shows it from the FRONT twice (two different relaxed stances), the bottom row shows it from BEHIND twice (two different relaxed stances). Same design, same outfit, same colors, same size in all 4 cells.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Élémentaire de cristal (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: floating humanoid elemental made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), no legs, shards hovering apart at the joints
- Head: pointed crystal head with two glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF)
- Details: a glowing ice-blue core in the chest
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no feet on the ground, no weapon, no clothes.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in all 4 cells; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites — one per cell of the 2 x 2 grid, never more, no extra or duplicated row. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
CELLS — follow the grid positions EXACTLY:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
Every sprite faces RIGHT (front-right on the top row, away toward the upper right on the bottom row): never facing left, never a pure side profile. The two sprites of a row are clearly different stances, never the same drawing twice.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF) — not cream, not beige, not ivory, no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in every cell; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
REMINDER: this is Élémentaire de cristal: floating humanoid elemental made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), no legs, shards hovering apart at the joints; pointed crystal head with two glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF); a glowing ice-blue core in the chest. NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no feet on the ground, no weapon, no clothes. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Image edit of a sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE enemy monster: Élémentaire de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows this enemy monster, Élémentaire de cristal, 4 times: top row from the FRONT twice, bottom row from BEHIND twice, all facing right.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Élémentaire de cristal (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: floating humanoid elemental made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), no legs, shards hovering apart at the joints
- Head: pointed crystal head with two glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF)
- Details: a glowing ice-blue core in the chest
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no feet on the ground, no weapon, no clothes.
TASK: REMOVE every weapon, torch, tool or held object from the hands, claws or tail — this creature is unarmed. Nothing else changes.
CRITICAL — KEEP THE VIEWS: the top row stays FRONT views and the bottom row stays BACK views; the two sprites of a row stay two different stances. Never redraw the whole sheet from a single angle:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in every cell; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
CHANGE NOTHING ELSE: keep the exact same character, poses, sizes, outfit, hair, background and layout.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image.
REMINDER: this is Élémentaire de cristal: floating humanoid elemental made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), no legs, shards hovering apart at the joints; pointed crystal head with two glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF); a glowing ice-blue core in the chest. NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no feet on the ground, no weapon, no clothes. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Image edit — sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 6 action poses seen from the FRONT of ONE enemy monster: Élémentaire de cristal — an UNARMED creature (no weapon of any kind).
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows this enemy monster, Élémentaire de cristal, in 4 idle views (top row from the front, bottom row from behind). Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Élémentaire de cristal (enemy of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: floating humanoid elemental made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), no legs, shards hovering apart at the joints
- Head: pointed crystal head with two glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF)
- Details: a glowing ice-blue core in the chest
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no feet on the ground, no weapon, no clothes.
UNARMED: this creature has NO weapon, tool, torch, staff or held object of any kind in all 6 poses; it fights only with its own body (claws, teeth, fists, tail, magic). Never add an item.
TASK: replace the 4 idle views with 6 ACTION poses, ALL in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose, facing front-right in every pose. Never a pure side profile, never facing left.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. RISE: body stretched tall upward, arms raised.
2. LUNGE: body stretched forward, claws of prismatic blue and violet crystal shards reaching out.
3. SPIN: body whirling, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards trail around it.
4. HOVER: floating higher, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards orbs circling.
5. PULSE: arms spread, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards pulsing outward.
6. DRIFT: floating forward with the body tilted slightly ahead, a short trail behind.
The 6 poses MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF) — not cream, not beige, not ivory), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Élémentaire de cristal: floating humanoid elemental made of sharp violet crystal shards (#8A4FD8), no legs, shards hovering apart at the joints; pointed crystal head with two glowing ice-blue eyes (#9FE3FF); a glowing ice-blue core in the chest. NO weapon and no held object, ever. Forbidden: no feet on the ground, no weapon, no clothes. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

Sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 4 idle poses of ONE final boss: Zyphéron le Cristallin, armed with: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand.
The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites of the SAME character: the top row shows it from the FRONT twice (two different relaxed stances), the bottom row shows it from BEHIND twice (two different relaxed stances). Same design, same outfit, same colors, same size in all 4 cells.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Zyphéron le Cristallin (boss of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: tall crystal sorcerer in a long robe of shattered pale crystal plates (#CFE4FF)
- Head: crown of ice-blue shards, pale face, glowing violet eyes
- Weapon: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no hood, no beard.
WEAPON: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in all 4 cells: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The sheet contains EXACTLY 4 sprites — one per cell of the 2 x 2 grid, never more, no extra or duplicated row. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
CELLS — follow the grid positions EXACTLY:
1. TOP-LEFT cell: FRONT idle: 3/4 FRONT view, the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible; standing calm.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: FRONT idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 front view facing front-right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly toward the right, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); the face is visible and the drawing must not be a copy of cell 1.
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: BACK idle: 3/4 BACK view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right (back of the head and right shoulder visible); we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes; not a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: BACK idle, VARIANT: the same 3/4 back view toward the upper right, but a clearly DIFFERENT pose — the free hand rests on the hip, the head is turned slightly to the left, the weight is on the other leg (the weapon stays in its hand); no face, no eyes; the drawing must not be a copy of cell 3.
Every sprite faces RIGHT (front-right on the top row, away toward the upper right on the bottom row): never facing left, never a pure side profile. The two sprites of a row are clearly different stances, never the same drawing twice.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat medium gray background (#808080) (the character is pale, a white background would merge with it), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
WEAPON CHECK: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in every cell: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
REMINDER: this is Zyphéron le Cristallin: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand; tall crystal sorcerer in a long robe of shattered pale crystal plates (#CFE4FF); crown of ice-blue shards, pale face, glowing violet eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no hood, no beard. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

TASK: replace the 4 idle views with 6 ACTION poses, ALL in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose, facing front-right in every pose. Never a pure side profile, never facing left.

```text
Image edit — sprite sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG showing 6 action poses seen from BEHIND of ONE final boss: Zyphéron le Cristallin, armed with: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand.
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows this final boss, Zyphéron le Cristallin, in 4 idle views (top row from the front, bottom row from behind). Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories, weapon in the same hand. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged. Use the BACK views of the source as the reference for the back of the outfit.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Zyphéron le Cristallin (boss of the Cristaux nation)
- Body: tall crystal sorcerer in a long robe of shattered pale crystal plates (#CFE4FF)
- Head: crown of ice-blue shards, pale face, glowing violet eyes
- Weapon: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no hood, no beard.
WEAPON: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand. It is held in the SAME hand and is clearly visible in all 6 poses: never missing, never swapped for another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never a different shape or color.
TASK: replace the 4 idle views with 6 ACTION poses, ALL in the same view: 3/4 BACK view: the character is seen from behind and turns slightly to the right (back of the head and right shoulder visible), facing away from the viewer toward the upper right; we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes. Never a pure side profile, never facing left; no face and no eyes visible in any pose.
NATION PALETTE: silver white, sapphire blue, amethyst violet.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, with only a thin subtle violet highlight along the right edge (a clean edge highlight, NOT a glow, haze, flare or color tint over the sprite; identical lighting in every cell).
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. OVERHEAD STRIKE: staff raised high above the head with both hands.
2. THRUST: body leaning forward, staff tip pushed far ahead with a short prismatic blue and violet crystal shards spark.
3. SIDE SWING: staff swept horizontally at shoulder height, torso twisted.
4. FOCUS: eyes closed, staff held vertically in front of the face, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards orb at the top.
5. INVOCATION: staff raised high with both hands, prismatic blue and violet crystal shards swirling above the head.
6. WALK: mid-stride, one foot raised, arms swinging naturally, weapon held.
The 6 poses MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: prismatic blue and violet crystal shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat medium gray background (#808080) (the character is pale, a white background would merge with it)), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
WEAPON CHECK: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand — visible in EVERY one of the 6 poses (held or used).
REMINDER: this is Zyphéron le Cristallin: ornate crystal staff, RIGHT hand; tall crystal sorcerer in a long robe of shattered pale crystal plates (#CFE4FF); crown of ice-blue shards, pale face, glowing violet eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no hood, no beard. Every sprite faces RIGHT (front or back 3/4), never left.

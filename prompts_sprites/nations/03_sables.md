# Nation Sables (Désert)

Palette : sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents. Effets : swirling sand and amber shards. Contre-jour : warm golden.

Format 2 planches par personnage :

1. **Vues** — le personnage au repos vu sous 4 angles en quarts de tour (3/4 avant droite, 3/4 dos droite, 3/4 dos gauche, 3/4 avant gauche) : la caméra ne bouge pas, le personnage tourne sur lui-même. 2 vues plutôt de face, 2 plutôt de dos ; un seul angle par case, aucun doublon possible. Grille 2 × 2 sur image 2:1, poses largement espacées.
2. **Actions** — 2 attaques + 1 sort, chacune vue DE FACE puis DE DOS (3 colonnes × 2 rangées), générées **en édition** de la planche vues (image source = planche vues) : le personnage réellement dessiné sert d'ancre, il ne peut pas changer d'une planche à l'autre. L'arme est verrouillée d'une planche à l'autre (ligne WEAPON LOCK + rappel final). Repli : génération normale (la carte d'identité est recopiée dans chaque prompt).

Chaque prompt recopie la carte d'identité du personnage (`identites.py`) : aucune image à joindre. Ordre conseillé : 1) planche de style, 2) héros, 3) ennemis, 4) boss ; pour chaque personnage : vues puis actions. Prompt négatif : en bas de page.

## 1. Planche de référence (style de la nation)

Ne sert pas en jeu : elle fixe palette, matières et silhouettes, de face et de dos.

```text
Character lineup reference sheet for a chibi isometric tactical RPG: the Sables nation (Désert biome).
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents. Signature effects: swirling sand and amber shards.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: two rows with the same 6 characters in the same order, all in idle pose. Top row: 3/4 front view, facing front-right. Bottom row: 3/4 back view, seen from behind, turned toward the upper right. All feet of a row on the same ground line. Leave a wide empty gap (at least half a character width) between characters and between the two rows: nobody overlaps or touches anyone, weapons and capes included. Image aspect ratio 2:1, as large as possible.
CHARACTERS, left to right:
1. the hero (Géomancien: young geomancer with short brown hair, layered sand-gold robe with terracotta panels and amber gems, sandals and wraps, a golden staff topped with a large faceted amber crystal in the right hand).
2. Bandit des dunes (small desert jackal-folk bandit with orange fur, a sand-colored scarf and a curved dagger).
3. Scarabée géant (giant scarab beetle with a black and gold shell and golden horns).
4. Génie du désert (golden sand djinn with muscular arms and a lower body of swirling sand).
5. Sphinx (golden lion sphinx wearing a striped pharaoh headdress).
6. the final boss Zahor le Sableux (sand sovereign in ornate golden armor with sharp layered plates, crested golden helm, holding a tall golden staff with a giant amber crystal), about 1.5x taller than the others.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.

## 2. Héros

### Géomancien — 10 poses

2 planches : **vues** (4 angles en quarts de tour), puis **actions** (2 attaques + 1 sort, chacune vue de face puis de dos). La planche actions se génère **en édition** de la planche vues (image source = planche vues de ce personnage) : c'est ce qui garantit le même personnage et la même arme sur les deux planches. Fichiers dans `prototype/zimut/assets/sprites/players/` ; nomme tes images `geomancien_vues.png` et `geomancien_actions.png` pour que l'Atelier les reconnaisse.

#### Planche 1 — Vues · 4 angles (`vues`)

Génération normale, aucune image à joindre. La caméra ne bouge pas : le personnage tourne sur lui-même par quarts de tour — 2 vues plutôt de face, 2 plutôt de dos.

```text
Sprite sheet of ONE playable hero for a chibi isometric tactical RPG. The same character appears 4 times: the SAME relaxed idle pose (standing calm, weapon held in hand in every cell, eyes open) seen from 4 viewing angles. The CAMERA never moves: it stays fixed in front of the character while the character TURNS IN PLACE by exact quarter turns (90 degrees) between cells — same distance, same height, same framing, only the character rotates. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height, same proportions in every cell.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Géomancien (hero of the Sables nation)
- Hair: short brown hair (#7A4A28)
- Eyes: amber-brown eyes, always open
- Skin: light tan skin
- Top: layered sand-gold robe (#D9B26A) with terracotta panels (#B8562E) and small amber gems
- Bottom: sand-colored wrapped trousers
- Feet: brown sandals with cloth wraps
- Weapon: golden staff topped with a large faceted amber crystal (#F2A93B), RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no hood, no turban, no blue or green clothes.
WEAPON LOCK: the character HOLDS its weapon in its hand in EVERY cell — the hands are NEVER empty, the weapon is always visible on the drawing. The weapon and every accessory (quiver, scarf, cape, floating items) are IDENTICAL in all 4 cells: same shape, same color, same details, same hand as written in the ID card. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop, hide or omit it. The weapon matches the character's class.
Keep exactly the same design in every cell: same outfit, colors, proportions. Only the viewing angle changes from cell to cell.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
VIEWS, one per cell — follow the grid positions EXACTLY (successive quarter turns of the character, the camera stays fixed; the character's design and weapon never change; never a pure side profile):
1. TOP-LEFT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made ONE exact quarter turn to the right — seen from behind, back of the head and right shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper right; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile (a side profile means the turn went too far).
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made TWO exact quarter turns — seen from behind, back of the head and left shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper left; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character has made THREE exact quarter turns — faces the viewer and turns slightly to the left (face, chest and left side visible), facing front-left; both eyes visible.
All 4 cells show ONE character in ONE pose under 4 angles: TOP-LEFT and BOTTOM-RIGHT rather from the front, TOP-RIGHT and BOTTOM-LEFT rather from the back. Same height, same stance, same weapon held in the same hand everywhere. The pose does not change, only the angle — each turn is exactly a quarter turn, no more, no less.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
WEAPON CHECK: golden staff topped with a large faceted amber crystal (#F2A93B), RIGHT hand — the character visibly HOLDS it in every cell; hands are never empty.
REMINDER: this is Géomancien: golden staff topped with a large faceted amber crystal (#F2A93B), RIGHT hand; short brown hair (#7A4A28); amber-brown eyes, always open; layered sand-gold robe (#D9B26A) with terracotta panels (#B8562E) and small amber gems; light tan skin; sand-colored wrapped trousers; brown sandals with cloth wraps. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no hood, no turban, no blue or green clothes.

Image edit for a chibi isometric tactical RPG sprite sheet.
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows ONE playable hero, Géomancien, in 4 different views. Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories, weapon in the same hand. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Géomancien (hero of the Sables nation)
- Hair: short brown hair (#7A4A28)
- Eyes: amber-brown eyes, always open
- Skin: light tan skin
- Top: layered sand-gold robe (#D9B26A) with terracotta panels (#B8562E) and small amber gems
- Bottom: sand-colored wrapped trousers
- Feet: brown sandals with cloth wraps
- Weapon: golden staff topped with a large faceted amber crystal (#F2A93B), RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no hood, no turban, no blue or green clothes.
WEAPON LOCK: the weapon and every accessory stay EXACTLY as in the source image in all 6 poses: same shape, same color, same details, same hand. The weapon is held or used in EVERY pose — a cell without the weapon is wrong. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop or hide it.
TASK: replace the 4 views with 6 ACTION poses: 3 different actions, each shown TWICE — once seen from the front, once seen from behind. TOP ROW (poses 1-3), all in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose. BOTTOM ROW (poses 4-6), all in the same view: 3/4 BACK view: the character is seen from behind and turns slightly to the right (back of the head and right shoulder visible), facing away from the viewer toward the upper right; we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes. Never a pure side profile.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. OVERHEAD STRIKE: staff raised high above the head with both hands.
2. SIDE SWING: staff swept horizontally at shoulder height, torso twisted.
3. FOCUS: eyes closed, staff held vertically in front of the face, swirling sand and amber shards orb at the top.
4. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 1 — OVERHEAD STRIKE: staff raised high above the head with both hands.
5. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 2 — SIDE SWING: staff swept horizontally at shoulder height, torso twisted.
6. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 3 — FOCUS: eyes closed, staff held vertically in front of the face, swirling sand and amber shards orb at the top.
Poses 4-6 repeat poses 1-3 from behind: same action, same energy, same weapon, only the viewing angle changes. The 3 actions MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose in the same viewing angle; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF)), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Géomancien: golden staff topped with a large faceted amber crystal (#F2A93B), RIGHT hand; short brown hair (#7A4A28); amber-brown eyes, always open; layered sand-gold robe (#D9B26A) with terracotta panels (#B8562E) and small amber gems; light tan skin; sand-colored wrapped trousers; brown sandals with cloth wraps. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no hood, no turban, no blue or green clothes.

1. TOP-LEFT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made ONE exact quarter turn to the right — seen from behind, back of the head and right shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper right; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile (a side profile means the turn went too far).
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made TWO exact quarter turns — seen from behind, back of the head and left shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper left; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile.

Image edit for a chibi isometric tactical RPG sprite sheet.
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows ONE enemy monster, Bandit des dunes, in 4 different views. Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories, weapon in the same hand. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Bandit des dunes (enemy of the Sables nation)
- Body: small jackal-folk bandit standing on two legs, orange fur (#D9822B) with a cream muzzle
- Head: tall jackal ears, yellow eyes, sand-colored scarf (#E3CF9A) over the mouth
- Top: brown leather vest with a red sash
- Bottom: baggy sand-colored trousers, bare paws
- Weapon: one curved dagger in the RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no bow, no sword, no hood, no human face.
WEAPON LOCK: the weapon and every accessory stay EXACTLY as in the source image in all 6 poses: same shape, same color, same details, same hand. The weapon is held or used in EVERY pose — a cell without the weapon is wrong. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop or hide it.
TASK: replace the 4 views with 6 ACTION poses: 3 different actions, each shown TWICE — once seen from the front, once seen from behind. TOP ROW (poses 1-3), all in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose. BOTTOM ROW (poses 4-6), all in the same view: 3/4 BACK view: the character is seen from behind and turns slightly to the right (back of the head and right shoulder visible), facing away from the viewer toward the upper right; we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes. Never a pure side profile.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. CROSS SLASH: both daggers crossed high above the head, about to strike down.
2. SPIN: body twisted, arms spread to both sides, short swirling sand and amber shards slash arcs.
3. SHADOW KNEEL: kneeling, one hand on the ground, swirling sand and amber shards rising around.
4. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 1 — CROSS SLASH: both daggers crossed high above the head, about to strike down.
5. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 2 — SPIN: body twisted, arms spread to both sides, short swirling sand and amber shards slash arcs.
6. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 3 — SHADOW KNEEL: kneeling, one hand on the ground, swirling sand and amber shards rising around.
Poses 4-6 repeat poses 1-3 from behind: same action, same energy, same weapon, only the viewing angle changes. The 3 actions MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose in the same viewing angle; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF)), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Bandit des dunes: one curved dagger in the RIGHT hand; brown leather vest with a red sash; small jackal-folk bandit standing on two legs, orange fur (#D9822B) with a cream muzzle; tall jackal ears, yellow eyes, sand-colored scarf (#E3CF9A) over the mouth; baggy sand-colored trousers, bare paws. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no bow, no sword, no hood, no human face.

- Body: giant scarab beetle on six legs, glossy black shell (#1A1A1E) with gold edges and patterns (#E0B040)
- Head: big golden horn and two smaller golden horns, small red eyes
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no wings spread, no rider, no human body.
WEAPON LOCK: the character HOLDS its weapon in its hand in EVERY cell — the hands are NEVER empty, the weapon is always visible on the drawing. The weapon and every accessory (quiver, scarf, cape, floating items) are IDENTICAL in all 4 cells: same shape, same color, same details, same hand as written in the ID card. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop, hide or omit it. The weapon matches the character's class.
Keep exactly the same design in every cell: same outfit, colors, proportions. Only the viewing angle changes from cell to cell.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
VIEWS, one per cell — follow the grid positions EXACTLY (successive quarter turns of the character, the camera stays fixed; the character's design and weapon never change; never a pure side profile):
1. TOP-LEFT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made ONE exact quarter turn to the right — seen from behind, back of the head and right shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper right; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile (a side profile means the turn went too far).
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made TWO exact quarter turns — seen from behind, back of the head and left shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper left; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character has made THREE exact quarter turns — faces the viewer and turns slightly to the left (face, chest and left side visible), facing front-left; both eyes visible.
All 4 cells show ONE character in ONE pose under 4 angles: TOP-LEFT and BOTTOM-RIGHT rather from the front, TOP-RIGHT and BOTTOM-LEFT rather from the back. Same height, same stance, same weapon held in the same hand everywhere. The pose does not change, only the angle — each turn is exactly a quarter turn, no more, no less.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Scarabée géant: giant scarab beetle on six legs, glossy black shell (#1A1A1E) with gold edges and patterns (#E0B040); big golden horn and two smaller golden horns, small red eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no wings spread, no rider, no human body.

Image edit for a chibi isometric tactical RPG sprite sheet.
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows ONE enemy monster, Scarabée géant, in 4 different views. Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories, weapon in the same hand. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Scarabée géant (enemy of the Sables nation)
- Body: giant scarab beetle on six legs, glossy black shell (#1A1A1E) with gold edges and patterns (#E0B040)
- Head: big golden horn and two smaller golden horns, small red eyes
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no wings spread, no rider, no human body.
WEAPON LOCK: the weapon and every accessory stay EXACTLY as in the source image in all 6 poses: same shape, same color, same details, same hand. The weapon is held or used in EVERY pose — a cell without the weapon is wrong. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop or hide it.
TASK: replace the 4 views with 6 ACTION poses: 3 different actions, each shown TWICE — once seen from the front, once seen from behind. TOP ROW (poses 1-3), all in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose. BOTTOM ROW (poses 4-6), all in the same view: 3/4 BACK view: the character is seen from behind and turns slightly to the right (back of the head and right shoulder visible), facing away from the viewer toward the upper right; we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes. Never a pure side profile.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. REARING: standing up on the hind legs, front claws raised high.
2. SIDE SWIPE: head and claws swept to the side, body twisted.
3. HOWL: head raised to the sky, swirling sand and amber shards gathering around the body.
4. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 1 — REARING: standing up on the hind legs, front claws raised high.
5. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 2 — SIDE SWIPE: head and claws swept to the side, body twisted.
6. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 3 — HOWL: head raised to the sky, swirling sand and amber shards gathering around the body.
Poses 4-6 repeat poses 1-3 from behind: same action, same energy, same weapon, only the viewing angle changes. The 3 actions MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose in the same viewing angle; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF)), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Scarabée géant: giant scarab beetle on six legs, glossy black shell (#1A1A1E) with gold edges and patterns (#E0B040); big golden horn and two smaller golden horns, small red eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no wings spread, no rider, no human body.

Sprite sheet of ONE enemy monster for a chibi isometric tactical RPG. The same character appears 4 times: the SAME relaxed idle pose (standing calm, weapon held in hand in every cell, eyes open) seen from 4 viewing angles. The CAMERA never moves: it stays fixed in front of the character while the character TURNS IN PLACE by exact quarter turns (90 degrees) between cells — same distance, same height, same framing, only the character rotates. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height, same proportions in every cell.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Génie du désert (enemy of the Sables nation)

- Bottom: no legs: lower body of swirling sand (#D9C08A)
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no weapon, no blue skin, no clothes on the torso.
WEAPON LOCK: the character HOLDS its weapon in its hand in EVERY cell — the hands are NEVER empty, the weapon is always visible on the drawing. The weapon and every accessory (quiver, scarf, cape, floating items) are IDENTICAL in all 4 cells: same shape, same color, same details, same hand as written in the ID card. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop, hide or omit it. The weapon matches the character's class.
Keep exactly the same design in every cell: same outfit, colors, proportions. Only the viewing angle changes from cell to cell.

VIEWS, one per cell — follow the grid positions EXACTLY (successive quarter turns of the character, the camera stays fixed; the character's design and weapon never change; never a pure side profile):
1. TOP-LEFT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made ONE exact quarter turn to the right — seen from behind, back of the head and right shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper right; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile (a side profile means the turn went too far).
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made TWO exact quarter turns — seen from behind, back of the head and left shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper left; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character has made THREE exact quarter turns — faces the viewer and turns slightly to the left (face, chest and left side visible), facing front-left; both eyes visible.
All 4 cells show ONE character in ONE pose under 4 angles: TOP-LEFT and BOTTOM-RIGHT rather from the front, TOP-RIGHT and BOTTOM-LEFT rather from the back. Same height, same stance, same weapon held in the same hand everywhere. The pose does not change, only the angle — each turn is exactly a quarter turn, no more, no less.

TOP ROW (poses 1-3), all in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose. BOTTOM ROW (poses 4-6), all in the same view: 3/4 BACK view: the character is seen from behind and turns slightly to the right (back of the head and right shoulder visible), facing away from the viewer toward the upper right; we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes. Never a pure side profile.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. REARING: standing up on the hind legs, front claws raised high.
2. SIDE SWIPE: head and claws swept to the side, body twisted.
3. HOWL: head raised to the sky, swirling sand and amber shards gathering around the body.
4. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 1 — REARING: standing up on the hind legs, front claws raised high.
5. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 2 — SIDE SWIPE: head and claws swept to the side, body twisted.
6. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 3 — HOWL: head raised to the sky, swirling sand and amber shards gathering around the body.
Poses 4-6 repeat poses 1-3 from behind: same action, same energy, same weapon, only the viewing angle changes. The 3 actions MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose in the same viewing angle; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF)), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Sphinx: golden lion sphinx on four legs (#D9A848) with a lion tail; human-like calm face, striped blue-and-gold pharaoh headdress (#2E56A8, #E0B040), kohl-lined amber eyes; small golden collar, no wings. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no wings, no weapon, standing on four legs only.

## 4. Boss

### Zahor le Sableux — 10 poses

2 planches : **vues** (4 angles en quarts de tour), puis **actions** (2 attaques + 1 sort, chacune vue de face puis de dos). La planche actions se génère **en édition** de la planche vues (image source = planche vues de ce personnage) : c'est ce qui garantit le même personnage et la même arme sur les deux planches. Fichiers dans `prototype/zimut/assets/sprites/nations/boss/` ; nomme tes images `sables_vues.png` et `sables_actions.png` pour que l'Atelier les reconnaisse.

#### Planche 1 — Vues · 4 angles (`vues`)

Génération normale, aucune image à joindre. La caméra ne bouge pas : le personnage tourne sur lui-même par quarts de tour — 2 vues plutôt de face, 2 plutôt de dos.

```text
Sprite sheet of ONE final boss for a chibi isometric tactical RPG. The same character appears 4 times: the SAME relaxed idle pose (standing calm, weapon held in hand in every cell, eyes open) seen from 4 viewing angles. The CAMERA never moves: it stays fixed in front of the character while the character TURNS IN PLACE by exact quarter turns (90 degrees) between cells — same distance, same height, same framing, only the character rotates. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height, same proportions in every cell.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Zahor le Sableux (boss of the Sables nation)
- Body: sand sovereign in ornate golden armor (#D4A63A) with sharp layered plates
- Head: crested golden helm, dark face shadow with glowing amber eyes
- Weapon: tall golden staff with a giant amber crystal, RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no cape, no sword.
WEAPON LOCK: the character HOLDS its weapon in its hand in EVERY cell — the hands are NEVER empty, the weapon is always visible on the drawing. The weapon and every accessory (quiver, scarf, cape, floating items) are IDENTICAL in all 4 cells: same shape, same color, same details, same hand as written in the ID card. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop, hide or omit it. The weapon matches the character's class.
Keep exactly the same design in every cell: same outfit, colors, proportions. Only the viewing angle changes from cell to cell.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 4 poses arranged as 2 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like four separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its quarter of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own quarter, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 4 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
VIEWS, one per cell — follow the grid positions EXACTLY (successive quarter turns of the character, the camera stays fixed; the character's design and weapon never change; never a pure side profile):
1. TOP-LEFT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right; both eyes visible.
2. TOP-RIGHT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made ONE exact quarter turn to the right — seen from behind, back of the head and right shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper right; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile (a side profile means the turn went too far).
3. BOTTOM-LEFT cell: 3/4 BACK view: the character has made TWO exact quarter turns — seen from behind, back of the head and left shoulder visible, facing away toward the upper left; no face, no eyes; NOT a pure side profile.
4. BOTTOM-RIGHT cell: 3/4 FRONT view: the character has made THREE exact quarter turns — faces the viewer and turns slightly to the left (face, chest and left side visible), facing front-left; both eyes visible.
All 4 cells show ONE character in ONE pose under 4 angles: TOP-LEFT and BOTTOM-RIGHT rather from the front, TOP-RIGHT and BOTTOM-LEFT rather from the back. Same height, same stance, same weapon held in the same hand everywhere. The pose does not change, only the angle — each turn is exactly a quarter turn, no more, no less.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own quarter of the image.
BACKGROUND: Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
WEAPON CHECK: tall golden staff with a giant amber crystal, RIGHT hand — the character visibly HOLDS it in every cell; hands are never empty.
REMINDER: this is Zahor le Sableux: tall golden staff with a giant amber crystal, RIGHT hand; sand sovereign in ornate golden armor (#D4A63A) with sharp layered plates; crested golden helm, dark face shadow with glowing amber eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no cape, no sword.

Image edit for a chibi isometric tactical RPG sprite sheet.
SOURCE IMAGE: it shows ONE final boss, Zahor le Sableux, in 4 different views. Keep EXACTLY the character of the source image: same face, hair color, eyes, outfit, colors, proportions, accessories, weapon in the same hand. The 6 new poses must show this SAME character, unchanged.
CHARACTER ID CARD — copy these features EXACTLY in every pose; they NEVER change between images:
- Name: Zahor le Sableux (boss of the Sables nation)
- Body: sand sovereign in ornate golden armor (#D4A63A) with sharp layered plates
- Head: crested golden helm, dark face shadow with glowing amber eyes
- Weapon: tall golden staff with a giant amber crystal, RIGHT hand
- Nothing else: do not add clothing, colors or accessories that are not listed.
- FORBIDDEN variations: no cape, no sword.
WEAPON LOCK: the weapon and every accessory stay EXACTLY as in the source image in all 6 poses: same shape, same color, same details, same hand. The weapon is held or used in EVERY pose — a cell without the weapon is wrong. Never replace the weapon with another weapon (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff), never change its color or shape, never drop or hide it.
TASK: replace the 4 views with 6 ACTION poses: 3 different actions, each shown TWICE — once seen from the front, once seen from behind. TOP ROW (poses 1-3), all in the same view: 3/4 FRONT view: the character faces the viewer and turns slightly to the right (face, chest and right side visible), facing front-right in every pose. BOTTOM ROW (poses 4-6), all in the same view: 3/4 BACK view: the character is seen from behind and turns slightly to the right (back of the head and right shoulder visible), facing away from the viewer toward the upper right; we see the BACK of the head: no face, no eyes. Never a pure side profile.
NATION PALETTE: sand gold, terracotta, amber, small turquoise accents.
STYLE: Ankama style (Dofus, Waven, Wakfu): chibi proportions with a very big head (about 40% of total height), short round body, big hands, small rounded feet, large expressive eyes, soft rounded shapes everywhere. Clean bold dark-brown outlines (thicker on the outer silhouette, thinner inside), flat colors with 2-3 tone cel shading and very few gradients, crisp material details (metal shine, fabric folds, leather straps), saturated but harmonious colors, strong readable silhouette at small size. Soft key light from the upper left, subtle warm golden rim light on the right edge.
LAYOUT: 6 poses arranged as 3 columns x 2 rows on a wide 2:1 image (as large as possible, e.g. 2048x1024), like six separate stickers floating on the background. Each pose occupies at most 55% of the width and height of its sixth of the image and is centered in it, so that there is a wide empty space, especially horizontally, between any two poses; the character AND its weapon, cape, hair, tail and effects stay inside its own sixth, nothing touches or overlaps a neighbouring pose. Long weapons, capes and wide effects are drawn smaller or tucked in so they fit. The 6 sprites have EXACTLY the same size: same scale, same height in pixels, same proportions — if one sprite looks bigger or smaller than the others it is wrong. Feet on the same ground line in each row. No frames, boxes, borders or dividing lines between poses, no floor, no grid on the ground.
POSES, left to right, top to bottom:
1. OVERHEAD STRIKE: staff raised high above the head with both hands.
2. SIDE SWING: staff swept horizontally at shoulder height, torso twisted.
3. FOCUS: eyes closed, staff held vertically in front of the face, swirling sand and amber shards orb at the top.
4. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 1 — OVERHEAD STRIKE: staff raised high above the head with both hands.
5. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 2 — SIDE SWING: staff swept horizontally at shoulder height, torso twisted.
6. Seen from BEHIND, the SAME action as pose 3 — FOCUS: eyes closed, staff held vertically in front of the face, swirling sand and amber shards orb at the top.
Poses 4-6 repeat poses 1-3 from behind: same action, same energy, same weapon, only the viewing angle changes. The 3 actions MUST be clearly different from each other: different arm, leg and weapon positions, different body angle and height. Never repeat or copy a pose in the same viewing angle; if two poses look alike, change one.
EFFECTS: swirling sand and amber shards, stylized, opaque, with dark outlines, small, kept close to the character inside its own sixth of the image.
BACKGROUND: keep the plain flat background of the source image (Pure flat white background (#FFFFFF)), no checkerboard pattern, no gradient, no floor, no ground shadow, no text, no labels, no numbers, no arrows, no frame or border lines.
REMINDER: this is Zahor le Sableux: tall golden staff with a giant amber crystal, RIGHT hand; sand sovereign in ornate golden armor (#D4A63A) with sharp layered plates; crested golden helm, dark face shadow with glowing amber eyes. The WEAPON never changes and is never replaced (a bow stays a bow, a staff stays a staff). Forbidden: no cape, no sword.
